## Current Project State

### What We're Building

A comprehensive Bayesian inference system with three main components:

1. **Energy Disaggregation Models**: Infer HVAC, hot water, appliances, lighting from total consumption
2. **Program Benefit Prediction**: Predict which households benefit most from efficiency programs
3. **Messaging Optimization**: Analyze 69 campaign messages to determine what works best

**Technical Stack**: PyMC 5 + JAX + GPU (NVIDIA RTX A6000, 48GB VRAM, CUDA 12.4)

### Implementation Strategy

- **Phase 0**: GPU validation (2 hours) - **← YOU ARE HERE**
- **Phase 1-2**: Messaging models (Week 1) - Simple, fast validation
- **Phase 3-4**: Energy models (Week 2-3) - Parallel effort, more complex
- **Phase 5+**: Integration and production deployment

---

## What We Just Completed

### Documents Created

1. **`bayesian_modeling_framework.md`** (30 pages)
   - Comprehensive framework for all three model types
   - Updated with PyMC 5 + JAX + GPU specifications
   - Includes Quick Start guide for GPU validation
   - Full implementation workflows

2. **`research_bayesian_performance_20251015.md`** (30 pages)
   - Performance comparison: PyMC vs Stan (C++) vs Rust
   - Conclusion: Stay with PyMC, add JAX backend
   - Expected speedup: 10-20x for hierarchical models

3. **`phase0_gpu_validation_prd.md`** (JUST COMPLETED)
   - Product Requirements Document for Phase 0
   - 4 deliverables with complete code
   - 2-hour timeline
   - Success criteria: 3-8x GPU speedup

### Key Decisions Made

1. **Start with messaging models** (simpler, faster results)
2. **Energy modeling in parallel** (more complex)
3. **User has all 69 campaign messages** (ready for analysis)
4. **Experimenting now, production later**
5. **GPU acceleration validated before scaling**

---

## Next Immediate Steps

### Option 1: Review PRD First
Read `/home/frich/devel/EmpowerSaves/octopus/claudedocs/phase0_gpu_validation_prd.md` and provide feedback.

### Option 2: Implement Phase 0 Now
Create the actual implementation files:
- `scripts/verify_gpu.py`
- `models/test_hierarchical_gpu.py`
- `benchmarks/cpu_vs_gpu_benchmark.py`
- `claudedocs/phase0_setup_guide.md`

All code is already written in the PRD - just needs to be extracted into files.

### Option 3: Jump to Phase 1
Skip GPU validation for now, start building messaging model with real campaign data.

## Key Technical Context

### Hardware Specifications
- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX A6000
- **VRAM**: 48GB
- **CUDA**: 12.4
- **Compute Capability**: 8.6

### Software Requirements
```txt
pymc>=5.0.0                    # Latest with JAX support
jax[cuda12]>=0.4.20            # CUDA 12 support
numpyro>=0.15.0                # JAX-based NUTS sampler

arviz>=0.18.0                  # Diagnostics
```

### Performance Expectations
- **Phase 0 test model**: 3-8x speedup (simple hierarchy, 100 groups)
- **Messaging models**: 5-10x speedup (medium complexity, 70 campaigns)
- **Energy models**: 10-20x speedup (complex hierarchy, 1000+ households)

### Key Code Pattern (GPU Sampling)
```python
# CPU (old way)
trace = pm.sample(2000, tune=1000, chains=4)

# GPU (new way) - SINGLE LINE CHANGE
trace = pm.sampling_jax.sample_numpyro_nuts(2000, tune=1000, chains=4)
```

## Campaign Data Context

### Data Structure
- **Location**: `/home/frich/devel/EmpowerSaves/octopus/data/exports/*.csv`
- **Campaigns**: 69+ unique campaigns
- **Total sends**: ~140K
- **Columns**: campaign_name, opened, clicked, applied, age, income, YearBuilt, county

### Example Campaign Message
User provided sample showing psychological qualities:
- Loss aversion framing
- Concrete numbers ($48/month)
- Social proof (neighbors)
- Free/no-risk messaging
- Qualification framing

### Conversion Funnel
1. **Sent** → **Opened** (email open rate)
2. **Opened** → **Clicked** (engagement rate)
3. **Clicked** → **Applied** (conversion rate)

Model will be 3-stage hierarchical logistic regression.

---

## Existing Research Context

### From `lab/AC Power Consumption.ipynb`
- Already using PyMC 5.0.2
- Temperature-dependent AC modeling
- Non-centered parameterization implemented
- Causal DAG approach (Statistical Rethinking style)

### From `lab/Baseloads Via Aggregation.ipynb`
- Lighting: N-dependent usage
- Stoves/ovens: 88% electric penetration
- Hot water: 74% electric, occupancy-dependent
- Hamilton County demographics available

These can serve as **priors** for the energy disaggregation models.

---

## Project Philosophy

### Statistical Approach
- **Framework**: Statistical Rethinking (Richard McElreath)
- **Philosophy**: Jaynesian Bayesian inference
- **Method**: Hierarchical models with partial pooling
- **Validation**: Posterior predictive checks, WAIC/LOO

### Implementation Principles
1. **Start Simple**: Validate workflow before scaling
2. **GPU First**: Establish acceleration before complex models
3. **Messaging Before Energy**: Faster feedback loop
4. **Parallel Development**: Energy models alongside messaging
5. **Production Ready**: Eventually deploy to production

## How to Resume Session

### Tell Claude Exactly This

> "I'm continuing the Bayesian modeling session from a different computer. Please read `claudedocs/SESSION_HANDOFF_20251015.md` to understand the full context, then read `claudedocs/phase0_gpu_validation_prd.md` which we just completed.
>
> We're at the point where we need to decide: should we implement Phase 0 (GPU validation) now, or skip ahead to Phase 1 (messaging models)? What do you recommend?"

### Alternative Resume Prompts

**If you want to implement Phase 0**:
> "Read the session handoff and Phase 0 PRD. Let's implement Phase 0 now - create all four deliverables (verify_gpu.py, test_hierarchical_gpu.py, cpu_vs_gpu_benchmark.py, phase0_setup_guide.md)."

**If you want to skip to messaging**:
> "Read the session handoff and bayesian_modeling_framework.md. Let's skip Phase 0 validation for now and jump straight to Phase 1 - building the messaging effectiveness model with the 69 campaigns."

**If you want to explore campaign data first**:
> "Read the session handoff. Before implementing anything, let's explore the campaign data in `data/exports/` - load the CSVs, understand the structure, and extract all 69 campaign messages with their psychological qualities."

---

## Outstanding Questions

1. **GPU Validation Priority**: Do we validate GPU setup (Phase 0) before building real models, or trust it will work and start Phase 1?

2. **Campaign Message Extraction**: Should we systematically extract and categorize all 69 messages by psychological qualities before modeling?

3. **Environment Setup**: Has the `bayesian_gpu` conda environment been created yet, or does that need to happen?

4. **CUDA Verification**: Has CUDA 12.4 been verified as working on the target machine?

---

## Files to Read (Priority Order)

### High Priority (Read First)
1. **`SESSION_HANDOFF_20251015.md`** (this file) - Full context
2. **`phase0_gpu_validation_prd.md`** - What we just completed
3. **`bayesian_modeling_framework.md`** - Overall framework (skim sections)

### Medium Priority (Read as Needed)
4. **`research_bayesian_performance_20251015.md`** - Performance research
5. **`../lab/AC Power Consumption.ipynb`** - Existing energy model
6. **`../lab/Baseloads Via Aggregation.ipynb`** - Baseload models

### Low Priority (Reference)
7. Campaign CSV files in `data/exports/`

---

## Quick Reference Commands

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Create environment (if not done)
conda create -n bayesian_gpu python=3.11
conda activate bayesian_gpu

# Install dependencies
pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda12]==0.4.20" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
pip install pymc>=5.0.0 numpyro>=0.15.0 arviz>=0.18.0 blackjax>=1.0.0

# Verify GPU
python -c "import jax; print(jax.devices())"
```

### Phase 0 Execution
```bash
# After creating files from PRD
python scripts/verify_gpu.py
cd models && python test_hierarchical_gpu.py
cd benchmarks && python cpu_vs_gpu_benchmark.py
```

### Data Exploration
```bash
# List campaign files
ls -lh data/exports/

# Quick CSV inspection
head -20 data/exports/*.csv | grep -i campaign
```

---

## Success Criteria (Phase 0)

When you resume, Phase 0 is complete when:

- ✅ GPU detected by JAX (`verify_gpu.py` passes)
- ✅ Test model samples successfully on GPU
- ✅ Convergence diagnostics pass (R̂ < 1.01, ESS > 400)
- ✅ GPU speedup ≥ 3x vs CPU (target: 5x)
- ✅ All diagnostic plots generated
- ✅ Setup guide documentation complete

Then proceed to Phase 1: Messaging models with real campaign data.
