Right now, we calculate you are spending {{DailyCost|default(\"a lot of money\")}} every single day in electricity— that’s {{MonthlyCost}} a month . That's assuming the Ohio average cost of 15-cents per kilowatt hour. The good news? You likely qualify for free programs that cut those costs dramatically . We think we can save you about {{MonthlySaving}} every month —money you can use for the other important things in your life. These programs are completely free , funded by you through your taxes, and are offered through the state, federal and utility company programs. We believe you already qualify for this assistance.
