ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
================================================================================
The zipcode-to-county mapping in data/zipcode_to_county_cache.json has errors.

Incorrect Mappings:
- 44903, 44904 → AthensCounty (should be RichlandCounty)
  These are Mansfield/Lexington addresses in Richland County

- 43302, 43315 → AthensCounty (should be MarionCounty)
  These are Marion/Cardington addresses in Marion County

Impact:
- 2,755 participants mapped to AthensCounty had 0 matches
- Most are actually in RichlandCounty or MarionCounty
- Fixing the zipcode mapping would likely increase match rate to 60%+

Correct Mappings Observed:
- 44901, 44902, 44905-44907 → RichlandCounty ✓
- 43301, 43314, 43322, etc. → MarionCounty ✓

SAMPLE UNMATCHED (All incorrectly mapped to AthensCounty):
1. 45 CHAMBERS RD, MANSFIELD 44903 (should be RichlandCounty)
2. 2436 MIDDLE BELLVILLE RD, MANSFIELD 44904 (should be RichlandCounty)
3. 997 HOCH RD, MARION 43302 (should be MarionCounty)
4. 2757 COUNTY ROAD 165, CARDINGTON 43315 (should be MarionCounty)
