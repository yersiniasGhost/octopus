## Key Insights for Reporting

### Top Performers (engagement > 3%)
1. **Cluster 8** (7.3%): Middle income, low energy burden, newer homes
2. **Cluster 6** (5.3%): Low income but highly responsive to frequent campaigns
3. **Cluster 9** (3.3%): Financially stressed but engaged
4. **Cluster 1** (3.2%): Affluent with high exposure

### Underperformers (engagement < 2%)
1. **Cluster 2** (0.4%): Minimal campaign exposure - investigate
2. **Cluster 5** (1.5%): Affluent but disengaged - wrong messaging?
3. **Cluster 0** (1.6%): Below-average exposure

### Strategic Implications

| Finding | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Campaign count strongest predictor | Increase touchpoints for underexposed segments |
| Income NOT the driver | Don't exclude low-income from campaigns |
| Energy burden segments engage well | Financial need motivates engagement |
| Cluster 2 barely contacted | Audit campaign distribution |
