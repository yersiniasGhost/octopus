 Understanding Your Clustering Analysis Results

  Executive Summary for Your Manager

  The Key Finding: We discovered that campaign exposure patterns combined with demographics significantly predict who engages (p=0.0007), but demographics alone don't matter (p=0.85).

  What We Did (In Plain Terms)

  Think of this analysis like sorting your 7,078 campaign recipients into groups to understand who engages with your emails.

  The Three-Phase Approach

  Phase 1: "Are rich vs poor people more likely to click?"
           → Answer: No, demographics alone don't predict engagement

  Phase 2: "What if we add how many campaigns someone received?"
           → Answer: Better, but still not statistically significant

  Phase 3: "What if we use a smarter algorithm that finds hidden patterns?"
           → Answer: YES! We found meaningful groups with very different engagement rates

  The Numbers Your Manager Cares About

  Overall Engagement Rate

  - 154 out of 7,078 participants (2.18%) ever engaged with campaigns
  - This is your baseline - any cluster above this is "high performing"

  Phase 3 Results (The Significant Finding)

  | Cluster   | Participants | Engagement Rate | Key Characteristics                                    |
  |-----------|--------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
  | Cluster 7 | 13           | 7.7%            | Very old houses (344 yrs - data quality?), large homes |
  | Cluster 8 | 82           | 7.3%            | Higher income ($32K), newer homes, moderate campaigns  |
  | Cluster 6 | 76           | 5.3%            | Lower income, high campaigns (36), large homes         |
  | Cluster 1 | 816          | 3.2%            | Higher income ($40K), most campaigns (36)              |
  | Cluster 2 | 270          | 0.4%            | Low exposure (only 1-2 campaigns!)                     |

  Statistical Significance: Chi-square p=0.0007 means there's only a 0.07% chance this pattern occurred by random chance.

  What Predicts Engagement?

  We compared participants in high-engagement clusters vs low-engagement clusters:

  ┌─────────────────────┬──────────────────┬─────────────────┐
  │ Factor              │ High Engagement  │ Difference      │
  ├─────────────────────┼──────────────────┼─────────────────┤
  │ # of Campaigns      │ 32 campaigns     │ +103% MORE      │ ← Biggest driver!
  │ Estimated Income    │ $34,500          │ +38% higher     │
  │ Home Size           │ 1,523 sqft       │ +17% larger     │
  │ Energy Burden       │ 11.5%            │ -17% LOWER      │ ← Less financially stressed
  │ House Age           │ 74 years         │ Similar         │
  └─────────────────────┴──────────────────┴─────────────────┘

  The Actionable Insights

  1. Campaign Frequency Matters Most

  Participants who received ~32 campaigns engaged at 2-3x the rate of those who received only 1-2 campaigns. This suggests:
  - Persistence pays off
  - OR early engagers get more campaigns (need causal modeling to distinguish)

  2. Demographics Have Limited Predictive Power

  Income, house size, and energy burden matter somewhat, but:
  - Phase 1 (demographics only): p=0.85 - essentially random
  - You cannot predict engagement from demographics alone

  3. The "Low Exposure" Problem

  Cluster 2 (270 people) received only 1-2 campaigns and had the lowest engagement (0.4%). These might be:
  - Recent additions to your list
  - People who unsubscribed early
  - A segment worth investigating

  What This Means for Strategy

  For Targeting

  ❌ DON'T: "Let's only email high-income households"
     (Demographics alone don't predict engagement)

  ✅ DO: "Let's ensure consistent campaign exposure across all segments"
     (Campaign frequency is the strongest predictor)

  For Segmentation

  ❌ DON'T: Create segments based solely on income or home characteristics
  ✅ DO: Consider engagement history and exposure levels when segmenting

  For Causal Analysis (Next Steps)

  The correlation between campaigns and engagement could mean:
  1. More campaigns → More engagement (campaigns cause engagement)
  2. Early engagement → More campaigns (engaged users stay subscribed longer)

  Your Bayesian causal model can disentangle these using the cluster probabilities we generated.

  Quality Caveats to Report

  What's Strong

  - ✅ Statistical significance: p=0.0007 is highly significant
  - ✅ Stable clusters: Bootstrap ARI=0.80 means clusters are reproducible
  - ✅ Large sample: 7,078 participants provides good statistical power

  What's Weak

  - ⚠️ Cluster separation: Silhouette score=0.16 (clusters overlap somewhat)
  - ⚠️ Some small clusters: Clusters 7 (n=13) and 6 (n=76) are small
  - ⚠️ Data quality: Cluster 7 shows 344-year-old houses (likely data errors)

  One-Sentence Summary

  "We found that how many campaigns someone receives predicts engagement far better than who they are demographically, with high-exposure participants engaging at 3x the rate of
  low-exposure participants (p<0.001)."
